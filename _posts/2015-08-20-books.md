TL;DR A list of (mainly) non-fiction books I’ve got through in the last year(ish) at the bottom of the post
 
I spend a lot of time on trains; 38 return train trips this year already. And they’re all over two hours, either travelling Leeds to Birmingham or Leeds to London. That’s over six whole days travelling! Whilst I do find time to do a bit of work on trains, I’m never really comfortable enough (I don’t have the privilege of travelling first class) to do much work and the connectivity is too flaky to do anything technical, I find a better use of my time is researching and reading.
 
I find time to catch-up on my Feedly stream (https://feedly.com), read my Pocket cache (http://getpocket.com) and get lost in the Internet (http://www.darrenhutton.co.uk/procrastination).
 
**Train time is book time**
 
I don’t have an eReader (burglars took my Kindle!) so I have to make do with my iPad, which is less than ideal for reading as I’m easily distracted by all the other funky apps. So whilst I tend to buy eBooks, I still prefer a proper book – I also hate that I can’t share (without restriction) an eBook. I have managed to move on from CDs!
 
I recently read Digitizing Government, and after chatting to a colleague about it they asked about other recommendations. Hence, this post. I started to keep track of books in BookBuddy (http://www.kimicoapps.com) so it was easy to export my list and present here.
 
**Full list below, but here’s my top picks**

>I'm currently reading Reinventing Organizations by Fredric Laloux and it might just be the best I've read in a long time. Seriously, the thinking in this book has the potential to change the business world: http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-leadership/wp/2015/03/31/zappos-to-employees-get-behind-our-no-bosses-approach-or-leave-with-severance/
